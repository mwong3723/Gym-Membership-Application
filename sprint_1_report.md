## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * Team members completed their tasks in a timely manner.
  * Effective communication regarding progress.
  * Project workflow improved over time as initial setup challenges were resolved.
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Initial project setup was slow, which delayed early progress.
   * Late start on tasks reduced the time available for additional improvements.
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Earlier Start on Tasks: Begin working on tasks as soon as the sprint starts to allow more time for improvements and additional features.
   * Streamline Initial Setup for New Sprints: Document setup processes and best practices to ensure smoother onboarding and faster initial progress.
   * Enhance Sprint Planning: Allocate more time for planning at the start of each sprint to identify potential bottlenecks early and set realistic goals.
